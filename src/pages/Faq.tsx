        {
          question: 'How does SocialBoost work?',
          answer: 'Our service works by connecting your social media profiles with our network of genuine users. Once you place an order, we begin delivering the requested engagement (followers, likes, views, etc.) to your account in a gradual, natural-looking manner that complies with each platform\'s guidelines.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is SocialBoost safe to use?',
          answer: 'Yes, SocialBoost is designed with safety as a top priority. We never request passwords to your accounts and all our services comply with the terms of service for each social media platform. We use gradual delivery methods to ensure natural growth patterns that don\'t trigger platform security systems.'

          question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
          answer: 'We accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, and cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. All payments are processed through secure payment gateways to ensure your financial information remains protected.'

        {
          question: 'What happens if my order isn\'t delivered as promised?',

        {
          question: 'Do I need to make my account public to use your services?',
          answer: 'For most services, your account needs to be public during the delivery period so our network can access and engage with your content. Once delivery is complete, you can switch back to private if desired.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Will the engagement drop over time?',
          answer: 'Some natural fluctuation is normal on any social media platform. However, we offer refill guarantees on most services to maintain your engagement levels. The specific guarantee period is listed on each service page.'
